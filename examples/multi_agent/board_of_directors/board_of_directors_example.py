Board of Directors Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Board of Directors swarm feature
in the Swarms Framework. It shows how to create a board, configure it,
and use it to orchestrate tasks across multiple agents.

The example includes:
1. Basic Board of Directors setup and usage
2. Custom board member configuration
3. Task execution and feedback
4. Configuration management
