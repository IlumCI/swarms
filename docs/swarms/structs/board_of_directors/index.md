# Board of Directors - Multi-Agent Architecture

The Board of Directors is a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that implements collective decision-making through democratic processes, voting mechanisms, and role-based leadership. This architecture provides an alternative to single-director patterns by enabling collaborative intelligence through structured governance.

## üèõÔ∏è Overview

The Board of Directors architecture follows a democratic workflow pattern:

1. **Task Reception**: User provides a task to the swarm
2. **Board Meeting**: Board of Directors convenes to discuss and create a plan
3. **Voting & Consensus**: Board members vote and reach consensus on task distribution
4. **Order Distribution**: Board distributes orders to specialized worker agents
5. **Execution**: Individual agents execute their assigned tasks
6. **Feedback Loop**: Board evaluates results and issues new orders if needed (up to `max_loops`)
7. **Context Preservation**: All conversation history and context is maintained throughout the process

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Setup

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.board_of_directors_swarm import (
    BoardOfDirectorsSwarm,
    BoardMember,
    BoardMemberRole
)
from swarms.config.board_config import enable_board_feature

# Enable the Board of Directors feature
enable_board_feature()

# Create board members with specific roles
chairman = Agent(
    agent_name="Chairman",
    agent_description="Chairman of the Board responsible for leading meetings",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt="You are the Chairman of the Board..."
)

vice_chairman = Agent(
    agent_name="Vice-Chairman",
    agent_description="Vice Chairman who supports the Chairman",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt="You are the Vice Chairman..."
)

# Create BoardMember objects with roles and expertise
board_members = [
    BoardMember(chairman, BoardMemberRole.CHAIRMAN, 1.5, ["leadership", "strategy"]),
    BoardMember(vice_chairman, BoardMemberRole.VICE_CHAIRMAN, 1.2, ["operations", "coordination"]),
]

# Create worker agents
research_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Research-Specialist",
    agent_description="Expert in market research and analysis",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
)

financial_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analyst",
    agent_description="Specialist in financial analysis and valuation",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
)

# Initialize the Board of Directors swarm
board_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
    name="Executive_Board_Swarm",
    description="Executive board with specialized roles for strategic decision-making",
    board_members=board_members,
    agents=[research_agent, financial_agent],
    max_loops=2,
    verbose=True,
    decision_threshold=0.6,
    enable_voting=True,
    enable_consensus=True,
)

# Execute a complex task with democratic decision-making
result = board_swarm.run(task="Analyze the market potential for Tesla (TSLA) stock")
print(result)
```
